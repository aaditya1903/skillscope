# SkillScope Project Status

## Project contract

SkillScope is an Agent Skills observatory that discovers public `SKILL.md`
files, parses and validates them safely, stores reproducible metadata, and
compares lexical, dense and hybrid retrieval using objective evaluation.

The project's principal technical evidence is the evaluated retrieval system,
not the user interface.

## Release policy

- Repository visibility: private during development
- Public release: only after the `v0.1.0` definition of done passes
- Public metrics: generated from reproducible commands only
- Third-party bodies: never committed as a dataset
- Secrets: local environment variables only

## Current milestone

- Milestone: 5, idempotent ingestion
- Objective: combine bounded GitHub discovery and fetching with safe parsing, structural analysis and transactional database upserts
- Exit gate: a second identical run produces unchanged rather than duplicate records; every failure has a category and safe message; counts reconcile between manifest and database; at least 100 unique skills are ingested if available, otherwise the truthful discovery result and blocker are documented; no raw third-party corpus is committed
- Status: active

## Decisions

| Decision | Reason | Date | ADR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keep the repository private until release | Allows security and evidence review before publication | 2026-08-23 | Not required |
| Use Python 3.12 through `uv` | Strong dependency compatibility without modifying system Python | 2026-08-23 | Not required |
| Pin Node 24 LTS when frontend work begins | Prefer an LTS runtime for local development and CI | 2026-08-23 | Not required |
| Treat PostgreSQL as the source of truth | Required for realistic JSONB, migrations and pgvector behaviour | 2026-08-23 | Planned |
| Build evaluated retrieval before the interface | Evaluation is the project's central technical contribution | 2026-08-23 | Planned |
| Keep upstream skill bodies out of committed datasets | Respect licensing and redistribution boundaries | 2026-08-23 | Planned |
| Manage pgvector through the initial migration | Guarantees reproducible extension setup and a reversible clean-database migration | 2026-08-23 | Not required |
| Represent non-native enums with explicit named CHECK constraints | Preserves Python enum validation while allowing Alembic 1.19 to compare the constraints accurately | 2026-08-23 | Not required |
| Pin GitHub REST requests to version `2026-03-10` | Live contents response confirmed the selected version; explicit versioning prevents silent API drift | 2026-08-23 | Not required |
| Bound fetched skill files and directory metadata | Limits memory use and keeps untrusted GitHub responses within explicit ingestion constraints | 2026-08-24 | Not required |
| Deduplicate discovered skills by GitHub repository ID and path | Repository IDs remain stable across renames while the path identifies the file within a repository | 2026-08-24 | Not required |
| Store candidate manifests as canonical versioned JSONL | Supports deterministic diffs, streaming validation and reproducible discovery evidence without committing upstream bodies | 2026-08-24 | Not required |
| Treat discovery output as a reproducible sample rather than a census | GitHub search caps, scope restrictions, index changes and query choices make exhaustiveness unverifiable | 2026-08-24 | Not required |

## Blockers

No active blockers.

## Next three actions

1. Design typed ingestion orchestration results and safe failure categories.
2. Implement transactional repository and skill upserts with unchanged-SHA detection.
3. Add integration tests for first run, identical rerun, per-item failure and count reconciliation.
